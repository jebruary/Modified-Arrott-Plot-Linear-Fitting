# Modified Arrott Plot Linear Fitting
This code only needs data file of magnetic field and magnetisation, with B field as first column, and M as second column.

The normalised intercept here means intercept devided by the largest value of y data.

ATTENTION mind the size of steps and number of steps, DO NOT let beta to be negative, otherwise the intercept would be incrediblely huge and meaningless.

ATTENTION at the y axis, there is a scaling number.

The second script "several sets..." is for several data sets(different temperature) to fit and plot at the same picture, howver in this script the critical exponents are fixed(entered by the user).
